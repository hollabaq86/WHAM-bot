## Description

[WHAM-bot(@12DaysofWHAM)](https://twitter.com/12daysofwham) is a Twitter bot that regularly tweets the lyrics to Wham's "Last Christmas". It was designed using NodeJS with modules for Twitter's REST API, emoji-text, and MongoDB. Future releases will incorporate trivia tweets that respond to reply tweets with the correct answer.
